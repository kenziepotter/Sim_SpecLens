# Sim_SpecLens

This repository holds the code and plots that Noah Franz, Brian Bauer, and John Moustakas wrote to for Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectroscopic Lenses. The script in the py/ directory shows our method to simulate and separate spectroscopic lenses. The jupyter notebook in the py/ directory shows our analysis code to inspect the success of the script. Finally, the plots/ directory shows the figures we used for our presentation at the 237th American Astronomical Society (AAS) conference (poster: aas237-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=DC-94-42-5E-D2-F5-DD-03-EF-41-02-A1-DC-4A-63-DE).
